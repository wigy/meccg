# Card Effects DSL

Every card's effects are described declaratively in the JSON card database. A resolver engine evaluates them at each decision point by collecting all in-play effects, filtering by conditions, and computing final values.

## Condition Language

Conditions use MongoDB-style query operators. An object with multiple keys is an implicit AND.

```json
{ "bearer.race": "hobbit" }
{ "reason": "combat", "enemy.race": "orc" }
{ "$and": [{ "reason": "combat" }, { "enemy.race": "orc" }] }
{ "$or": [{ "enemy.race": "undead" }, { "enemy.race": "nazgul" }] }
{ "$not": { "enemy.race": "undead" } }
{ "bearer.skills": { "$includes": "warrior" } }
```

A missing `when` means the effect always applies.

## Value Expressions

Plain numbers for the simple case, string expressions (evaluated with MathJS) when formulas are needed:

```json
"value": 3
"value": "bearer.baseProwess * 2"
"max": 8
"max": "bearer.baseProwess * 2"
```

MathJS gets custom context variables injected: `bearer`, `enemy`, `company`, `self` (the card), `target`, `faction`, etc.

## Effect Types

### 1. `stat-modifier`

Modifies a character stat. Supports optional `max` (cap), `id` (for override targeting), and `overrides` (replaces a named effect when condition matches).

```json
{ "type": "stat-modifier", "stat": "prowess", "value": 3, "max": 8,
  "id": "glamdring-prowess" }
{ "type": "stat-modifier", "stat": "prowess", "value": 3, "max": 9,
  "overrides": "glamdring-prowess",
  "when": { "reason": "combat", "enemy.race": "orc" } }
```

Stats: `prowess`, `body`, `direct-influence`, `corruption-points`, `strikes`.

The `strikes` stat is used with `target: "all-attacks"` to modify the number
of strikes on creature and automatic attacks (e.g. Wake of War).

Optional `target` scopes:

- `"all-characters"` — applies to every character in play
- `"all-attacks"` — applies to every automatic-attack and hazard creature
- `"all-automatic-attacks"` — applies only to site automatic-attacks (not hazard creatures)
- *(no target)* on a hazard-creature card — self-modifier applied to the
  creature's own prowess at combat initiation. The context includes
  `company.facedRaces`, derived from `phaseState.hazardsEncountered` by
  looking up each faced hazard's race in the card pool, enabling
  conditions like Orc-lieutenant's +4 prowess. It also includes
  `defender.alignment` — the defending player's alignment in card-text
  terminology (`"hero"` for wizard-avatar players, `"ringwraith"`,
  `"fallen-wizard"`, or `"balrog"`) — so creatures like *Elf-lord
  Revealed in Wrath* can boost prowess against specific alignments
  (e.g. `{ "defender.alignment": "ringwraith" }` for "+4 vs
  Ringwraiths").

### 2. `check-modifier`

Modifies a 2d6 check roll. The `check` discriminator is one of the
{@link CheckKind} string literals — currently `corruption`, `influence`,
`riddling`, `offering`, `flattery`, `gold-ring-test` — and may be either
a single string or an array (logical OR; the modifier fires on any
listed kind). The array form is used by METD cards that read "any
riddling roll, offering attempt, or influence attempt by target
character is modified by -4" (Foolish Words, td-25).

```json
{ "type": "check-modifier", "check": "corruption", "value": 1 }
{ "type": "check-modifier", "check": "influence", "value": 1,
  "when": { "bearer.race": "dunadan" } }
{ "type": "check-modifier",
  "check": ["influence", "riddling", "offering"], "value": -4 }
```

The `influence` check type is used on faction cards for standard modifications.
The resolver context includes `bearer` (influencing character) and `faction`
(faction being influenced, with `name`, `race`, and `playableAt` — the flattened
array of site names from the faction's `playableAt` entries, enabling conditions
like `{ "faction.playableAt": "Variag Camp" }`).

For faction-influence checks the engine also collects `check-modifier` and
`stat-modifier` (`direct-influence`) effects from every ally in the
influencing character's company — e.g. The Warg-king's "+2 to any
influence attempt by a character in his company against a Wolf
faction" applies even when he is attached to a different host. Allies
are not collected for combat or other check contexts.

For corruption-check resolutions the engine also collects
`check-modifier` effects from attached **items** on the character being
checked (previously only the character's built-in `corruptionModifier`
and hazard modifiers were considered). Item modifiers see the same
context as hazard modifiers, plus `source.keywords` — the array of
keywords on the pending resolution's source card — so items can gate
their bonus on *what triggered the check*. Example (Wizard's Staff):

```json
{ "type": "check-modifier", "check": "corruption", "value": 2,
  "when": { "source.keywords": { "$includes": "spell" } } }
```

This fires only for corruption checks whose `source` card (the one that
enqueued the resolution) carries the `"spell"` keyword — e.g. the
check a Wizard makes after playing *Wizard's Laughter*.

### 2b. `attribute-modifier` active constraint

Generic conditional override of an entity attribute. Produced by an
`add-constraint` apply and consumed by read sites that route through
`engine/effective.ts::resolveEffective` (or that filter
`activeConstraints` directly). One kind in the union covers what used
to be three separate constraint kinds
(`auto-attack-prowess-boost`, `site-type-override`,
`region-type-override`); the next attribute is a one-line extension.

Fields:

- `attribute: AttributePath` — closed union: `auto-attack.prowess`,
  `site.type`, `region.type` (extend as cards require).
- `op: 'add' | 'override'` — `add` sums; `override` replaces.
- `value: number | string` — number for `add`; the encoded value
  (SiteType, RegionType, etc.) for `override`.
- `filter?: Condition` — optional per-read gate evaluated against a
  context exposing the entity under inspection
  (`{ site: { type, definitionId }, region: { name, type } }`).

The card-data JSON keeps the legacy constraint names
(`auto-attack-prowess-boost`, `site-type-override`,
`region-type-override`) — `buildConstraintKind` translates them into
`attribute-modifier` so existing card definitions did not need to
change during the migration.

### 3. `mp-modifier`

Modifies marshalling points conditionally.

```json
{ "type": "mp-modifier", "value": -3, "when": { "reason": "elimination" } }
```

### 4. `company-modifier`

Applies a stat modifier to every character in the bearer's company.

```json
{ "type": "company-modifier", "stat": "corruption-points", "value": 1 }
```

### 5. `enemy-modifier`

Modifies the enemy's stats during combat. The resolver collects
`enemy-modifier` effects from the defending character and their items,
evaluates conditions against the combat context (including `enemy.race`),
and applies operations to the enemy's stat.

Operations: `halve-round-up` — divide by 2, round up.

```json
{ "type": "enemy-modifier", "stat": "body", "op": "halve-round-up",
  "when": { "reason": "combat", "enemy.race": "nazgul" } }
```

### 6. `hand-size-modifier`

Modifies the player's hand size.

```json
{ "type": "hand-size-modifier", "value": 1,
  "when": { "self.location": "Rivendell" } }
```

### 6b. `draw-modifier`

Modifies the number of cards drawn during the movement/hazard draw step
for the bearer's company. The `draw` field selects which pool to modify
(`hazard` or `resource`), and `min` sets a floor (default 0). The
`value` may be a plain number or a {@link ValueExpr} string evaluated
against a context exposing `sitePath` counts (`wildernessCount`,
`shadowCount`, `darkCount`, `coastalCount`, `freeCount`,
`borderCount`) derived from the moving company's resolved site path —
used by Radagast for "+1 resource draw per Wilderness in the site
path".

```json
{ "type": "draw-modifier", "draw": "hazard", "value": -1, "min": 0 }
{ "type": "draw-modifier", "draw": "resource",
  "value": "sitePath.wildernessCount", "min": 0 }
```

### 7. `grant-action`

Gives the card bearer a new activated ability. For roll-based actions,
`rollThreshold` specifies the minimum 2d6 total for success.

**Phase-window flags.** By default a grant-action is emitted only in
its natural phase (organization for item-tap abilities, end-of-turn
for Saruman's spell-fetch, etc.). The following optional booleans
extend the emission window:

- `anyPhase: true` — activatable during any phase of the controller's
  turn (CRF 2.1.1). Used by Cram, Orc-draughts, and *Magical Harp*.
- `opposingSitePhase: true` — the non-active player may activate this
  ability during the active player's site phase (select-company,
  enter-or-skip, play-resources steps). Used by *Magical Harp*.
- `freeCouncil: true` — either player may activate during the Free
  Council corruption-checks step. Used by *Magical Harp*.

Multiple flags may coexist on the same effect.

Actions:

- `test-gold-ring` — tap Gandalf to test a gold ring in his company;
  rolls 2d6, discards the gold ring. Declared with a generic `targets`
  descriptor (`scope: "company-items"`, `filter: { "subtype":
  "gold-ring" }`) so the legal-action generator emits one activation
  per candidate ring. The apply is a generic `sequence` chaining
  `roll-check` and `discard-target-item` (implemented in
  `reducer-organization.ts`).
- `remove-self-on-roll` — roll 2d6, discard this card on success
  (implemented in `reducer-organization.ts`). Supported cost variants:
  `{ "tap": "bearer" }` (bearer taps, e.g. Lure of the Senses),
  `{ "tap": "self" }` (the item taps, e.g. shields / Magical Harp),
  `{ "discard": "self" }` (consumable discards, e.g. Cram) and
  `{ "tap": "sage-in-company" }` (an untapped sage in the bearer's
  company taps — one activation per eligible sage; Dragon's Curse).
- `gwaihir-special-movement` — discard this ally during organization to
  grant the company special movement to any non-Shadow-land/Dark-domain
  site. Only site-keyed hazard creatures may be played. Requires company
  size ≤ 2 (implemented in `reducer-organization.ts`,
  `organization-companies.ts`, `movement-hazard.ts`)
- `untap-bearer` — discard this item during organization to untap its
  bearer. Bearer must be tapped (implemented in `reducer-organization.ts`)
- `extra-region-movement` — discard this item during organization to
  grant the bearer's company +1 max region distance for movement this
  turn (implemented in `reducer-organization.ts`,
  `organization-companies.ts`, `reducer-movement-hazard.ts`)
- `saruman-fetch-spell` — tap Saruman at the beginning of the
  end-of-turn phase to take one spell card from the discard pile to
  hand. Only available to the resource player during the discard step.
  The spell filter is carried on the apply itself as a DSL `filter`
  condition against the candidate card definition (see
  `move-target-from-discard-to-hand` below). Implemented in
  `legal-actions/end-of-turn.ts`, `reducer-end-of-turn.ts`.
- `wizards-staff-fetch` — tap the bearer at the beginning of the
  end-of-turn phase to take one card with keyword `"spell"`,
  `"ritual"`, or `"light-enchantment"` from the discard pile to hand,
  then enqueue a corruption check on the bearer. Used by *Wizard's
  Staff*. Declared on an item with `"cost": { "tap": "bearer" }` and a
  `sequence` apply whose first step is `move-target-from-discard-to-hand`
  carrying a DSL `filter` (an `$or` over the three keywords); the
  second step is `enqueue-corruption-check`. The end-of-turn scanner
  walks both character-direct and attached-item grant-actions, offers
  one activation per discard-pile card matching the apply's filter,
  and requires an untapped bearer.
- `cancel-return-and-site-tap` — tap bearer (ranger) during
  organization to add a turn-scoped constraint cancelling hazard
  effects that force return to site of origin or tap the company's
  site. Bearer makes a corruption check (implemented in
  `reducer-organization.ts`)
- `cancel-character-discard` — tap the source item (cost
  `{ "tap": "self" }`) to add a turn-scoped
  `cancel-character-discard` constraint to the bearer's company and
  enqueue a corruption check on the bearer. The ability combines
  `anyPhase: true`, `opposingSitePhase: true`, and `freeCouncil:
  true` so the item is tappable during any of the owner's phases,
  during the opponent's site phase, and during the Free Council
  corruption-checks step. Used by *Magical Harp*. Implemented via
  the generic `sequence` + `add-constraint` + `enqueue-corruption-check`
  apply dispatch in `reducer-organization.ts`.
- `stinker-discard-with-ring` — discard the ally (Stinker) during
  organization when the bearer's company is at a non-haven site and
  some character at the same site holds *The One Ring*; the ring is
  discarded alongside the ally (regardless of which player owns it).
  Implemented via the `discard-named-card-from-company` apply (see
  below). The `when` condition reads `bearer.atHaven` and
  `site.hasOneRing` from the grant-action context (implemented in
  `legal-actions/organization.ts` context builder).
- `company-prowess-boost` — discard the source item to add a
  turn-scoped `company-stat-modifier` constraint giving `+value`
  prowess to every character in the bearer's company for the rest of
  the turn. Used by Orc-draughts (implemented in
  `reducer-organization.ts`, resolved through `collectCharacterEffects`
  in `engine/effects/resolver.ts`)

Action-less activations may also be declared directly on a character
card via `"apply"` on the grant-action effect, reusing the shared
TriggeredAction apply dispatch. The character's `"cost": { "tap": "self" }`
taps the character itself. Used by *The Mouth* to enqueue a
`fetch-to-deck` sub-flow that moves one resource or character from the
player's discard pile back to the play deck.

**Per-target activations** (`targets` field). A grant-action may carry
a `targets` descriptor that tells the legal-action generator to emit
one activation per matching card, each carrying the candidate's
`instanceId` as `targetCardId` on the resulting action. Fields:

- `scope` — zone to enumerate relative to the bearer. Supported:
  - `"company-items"` — items borne by any character in the bearer's
    company.
- `filter` — optional DSL `Condition` matched against each candidate's
  card definition; candidates that fail the filter are skipped.

Example (Gandalf's gold-ring test):

```json
{ "type": "grant-action", "action": "test-gold-ring",
  "cost": { "tap": "self" },
  "targets": { "scope": "company-items",
               "filter": { "subtype": "gold-ring" } },
  "apply": { "type": "sequence", "apps": [
    { "type": "roll-check", "check": "gold-ring-test" },
    { "type": "discard-target-item" }
  ] } }
```

```json
{ "type": "grant-action", "action": "test-gold-ring",
  "cost": { "tap": "self" },
  "when": { "company.hasItem": { "subtype": "gold-ring" } } }
{ "type": "grant-action", "action": "remove-self-on-roll",
  "cost": { "tap": "bearer" }, "rollThreshold": 8 }
{ "type": "grant-action", "action": "remove-self-on-roll",
  "cost": { "tap": "sage-in-company" },
  "apply": {
    "type": "roll-then-apply", "threshold": 7,
    "onSuccess": { "type": "discard-self" }
  } }
{ "type": "grant-action", "action": "gwaihir-special-movement",
  "cost": { "discard": "self" } }
{ "type": "grant-action", "action": "untap-bearer",
  "cost": { "discard": "self" } }
{ "type": "grant-action", "action": "extra-region-movement",
  "cost": { "discard": "self" } }
{ "type": "grant-action", "action": "saruman-fetch-spell",
  "cost": { "tap": "self" } }
{ "type": "grant-action", "action": "cancel-return-and-site-tap",
  "cost": { "tap": "bearer" } }
{ "type": "grant-action", "action": "cancel-character-discard",
  "cost": { "tap": "self" },
  "anyPhase": true, "opposingSitePhase": true, "freeCouncil": true,
  "apply": {
    "type": "sequence",
    "apps": [
      { "type": "add-constraint",
        "constraint": "cancel-character-discard",
        "scope": "turn", "target": "bearer-company" },
      { "type": "enqueue-corruption-check" }
    ] } }
{ "type": "grant-action", "action": "recall-to-deck",
  "cost": { "tap": "self" },
  "apply": {
    "type": "enqueue-pending-fetch",
    "fetchFrom": ["discard-pile"],
    "fetchCount": 1,
    "fetchShuffle": true,
    "filter": { "cardType": { "$in": [
      "minion-character", "minion-resource-item",
      "minion-resource-ally", "minion-resource-faction",
      "minion-resource-event"
    ] } }
  } }
```

### 8. `on-event`

Triggered effect that fires when a game event occurs.

```json
{ "type": "on-event", "event": "character-wounded-by-self",
  "apply": { "type": "force-check", "check": "corruption", "modifier": -2 },
  "target": "wounded-character" }
```

Events:

- `character-wounded-by-self` -- fires when a strike wounds a character, forcing a corruption check. Wounds enqueue a `corruption-check` pending resolution (see [Pending resolutions](#pending-resolutions) below) for the actor whose character was wounded; the resolution is scoped to the active company's MH or Site sub-phase, so it auto-clears at the company's sub-phase end. Implemented in `reducer-combat.ts`.
- `self-enters-play` -- fires when this card enters play. Used by environment permanent events to discard opposing cards (implemented in reducer play handlers).
- `untap-phase-end` -- fires once per applicable card during the Untap → Organization transition. The reducer (`reducer-untap.ts`) scans every character of the active player for attached cards (items / hazards / allies) carrying this on-event and enqueues a `corruption-check` pending resolution per match. An optional `when` condition is evaluated against the bearer context `{ bearer: { siteType, atHaven } }`, so cards that only fire at a haven (e.g. *Lure of the Senses*) express that as `"when": { "bearer.atHaven": true }`. Used by *Lure of the Senses* (at-haven only) and *The Least of Gold Rings* (any site).
- `attack-not-defeated` -- fires after combat finalization when the creature's attack was not fully defeated (i.e. not all strikes were won by the defenders). The reducer (`reducer-combat.ts`) checks the creature card for this event and applies its constraint. Used by *Little Snuffler*.
- `attack-defeated` -- fires after combat finalization when **all** strikes of an attack were fully defeated (all results = `success`). Scanned from every player's `cardsInPlay` in `reducer-combat.ts` when `allDefeated` is true. The condition context exposes `enemy.race` (the normalized race of the attack, e.g. `"undead"`). Supports `apply: { "type": "discard-self" }` to move the source card from `cardsInPlay` to the owning player's discard pile. Used by *The Moon Is Dead* (dm-71) to self-discard when any Undead attack is defeated.
- `company-arrives-at-site` -- fires when a hazard short-event resolves against a company in M/H. The handler (`applyShortEventArrivalTrigger` in `chain-reducer.ts`) iterates every `add-constraint` effect on the card with this event, evaluates the optional `when` against the arrival context, and applies the first matching one. This allows a single card to declare multiple mutually-exclusive modes (e.g. *Choking Shadows*). The arrival context exposes `company.destinationSiteType`, `company.destinationSiteName`, `company.destinationRegionType`, `environment.doorsOfNightInPlay`, and the standard `inPlay` card-name list.
- `end-of-company-mh` -- fires when a company's movement/hazard sub-phase ends (both players pass). For each character with an attached hazard carrying this event, enqueues one `corruption-check` pending resolution per region traversed in the site path. The `perRegion: true` flag on the effect enables the per-region behavior. An optional `regionTypeFilter: [...]` array restricts the iteration to regions whose type appears in the list — e.g. *Lure of Nature* uses `regionTypeFilter: ["wilderness"]` to enqueue a check only for each wilderness in the path. Used by *Alone and Unadvised* and *Lure of Nature*. Implemented in `reducer-movement-hazard.ts`.
- `company-composition-changed` -- fires against every attached hazard whenever a company's character roster changes (play-character, move-to-company, merge-companies, auto-merge at end of MH). The sweeper evaluates the effect's `when` against the bearer's company context and applies `discard-self` when the condition is met. Used by *Alone and Unadvised* (discards when company has 4+ characters). Implemented in `reducer-utils.ts` `sweepAutoDiscardHazards()`.
- `bearer-company-moves` -- fires when the company containing the bearer completes movement (M/H step 8). For each character in the moving company, the reducer scans attached items for this event and applies the `discard-self` action, moving the card to the owner's discard pile. Used by *Align Palantír*. Implemented in `reducer-movement-hazard.ts`.
- `creature-attack-begins` -- fires when a hazard creature attack is locked onto a defending company, after the creature's combat state has been initialized but before any strike is assigned. The attack was not canceled by the time this event fires (canceling an attack prevents `initiateCreatureCombat` from running entirely). Handled in `chain-reducer.ts` `initiateCreatureCombat()`. Supported apply types:
  - `offer-char-join-attack` — scoped to characters in the defending player's *other* companies that are at a haven; the `when` condition is evaluated against `{ bearer: { atHaven: true, siteType: 'haven' }, attack: { attackedCompanyId, bearerCompanyId } }`. Used by *Alatar* (tw-117).
  - `force-check-all-company` — enqueues a corruption check for every character in the attacked company before defenders are selected. Uses `check` (must be `"corruption"`) and optional `modifier`. Used by *Corpse-candle* (tw-23, le-67).
- `character-gains-item` -- fires immediately after any character in the bearer's company gains an item during the site phase (via `play-hero-resource`). For each character bearing a hazard with this event, enqueues one `corruption-check` pending resolution for that character (the bearer, not the character who gained the item). Supports `apply: { type: "force-check", check: "corruption" }`. Used by *Lure of Expedience* (le-122). Implemented in `reducer-site.ts` `fireCharacterGainsItemChecks()`.

Apply types:

- `force-check` -- force a check roll on the target. The dispatcher enqueues a {@link PendingResolution} of kind `corruption-check`; the resolver in `engine/pending-reducers.ts` runs the dice roll and applies the standard discard / eliminate consequences when the check fails.
- `force-check-all-company` -- under `on-event: creature-attack-begins`, enqueue a corruption check for **every** character in the attacked company before defenders are selected. Uses `check: "corruption"` and optional `modifier`. Implemented in `chain-reducer.ts` `initiateCreatureCombat()`. Used by *Corpse-candle* (tw-23, le-67).
- `discard-cards-in-play` -- discard all cards in play that match the `filter` condition (evaluated against card definitions).
- `discard-non-special-items` -- discard all non-special items (subtype ≠ `"special"`) from the wounded character. Items are moved to the defending player's discard pile. Implemented in `reducer-combat.ts` for the `character-wounded-by-self` event.
- `add-constraint` -- add an {@link ActiveConstraint} of the named kind to the target. Reserves the entry's `constraint` field for the kind name (e.g. `"site-phase-do-nothing"`, `"no-creature-hazards-on-company"`, `"deny-scout-resources"`, `"auto-attack-prowess-boost"`, `"auto-attack-duplicate"`, `"site-type-override"`, `"region-type-override"`, `"skip-automatic-attacks"`, `"cancel-character-discard"`) and the `scope` field for the auto-clear boundary (e.g. `"company-site-phase"`, `"company-mh-phase"`, `"turn"`, `"until-cleared"`). Constraint-kind-specific fields include `value` + `siteType` for `auto-attack-prowess-boost`, `overrideType` for `site-type-override` (the site is the active company's current site during site phase, or the destination during M/H phase), and `overrideType` + `regionName` for `region-type-override` (use the token `"destination"` as the region name to target the destination region of the active company). The `skip-automatic-attacks` constraint removes all automatic attacks from the bound site (resolved from the active company's current site during site phase). The `cancel-character-discard` constraint is placed by *Magical Harp* on the bearer's company; any future character-discard effect should consult this constraint to short-circuit the discard for the rest of the turn. The constraint filter in `legal-actions/pending.ts` rewrites legal actions for the affected target while the constraint lives.
- `discard-self` -- discard the card carrying this effect (typically an ally or attached hazard) from its bearer to the owning player's discard pile. Used with `company-arrives-at-site` + a `when` condition on `site.region` to enforce region-based restrictions (e.g. Treebeard), and with `company-composition-changed` + a `when` condition on `company.characterCount` to discard on company size (e.g. Alone and Unadvised). Implemented in `reducer-movement-hazard.ts` `fireAllyArrivalEffects()` and `reducer-utils.ts` `sweepAutoDiscardHazards()`.
- `discard-named-card-from-company` -- find an item attached to any
  character in any company at the bearer's current site (matched by
  site definition ID, so opposing companies co-located at the same
  site are included) whose card definition has the given `cardName`,
  and move it to that player's discard pile. Currently used by
  Stinker's ring-discard grant-action to discard *The One Ring* —
  potentially belonging to the opposing player — when the ally is
  discarded. Implemented in `reducer-organization.ts` `runGrantApply()`.
- `cancel-chain-entry` -- negate an unresolved chain entry or discard a
  card in play / remove active constraints sourced from a given card.
  Selectors:
  - `most-recent-unresolved-hazard` -- negate the latest unresolved
    hazard (creature or event) on the chain. Used by *Great Ship* via
    a granted action.
  - `target` -- negate the chain entry (or, if the target is no longer
    on the chain, discard the in-play card or remove active constraints
    whose `source` equals the target instance). The emitter filters
    valid targets using a `requiredSkill` field on the apply: only
    chain entries / active constraints whose source card has at least
    one effect carrying a matching `requiredSkill` (either directly on
    the effect — e.g. `cancel-attack.requiredSkill` on Concealment —
    or as the `requiredSkill` metadata tag on a `play-target` effect —
    e.g. Stealth) are offered. Used by *Searching Eye* with
    `requiredSkill: "scout"`.

  ```json
  { "type": "on-event", "event": "self-enters-play",
    "apply": { "type": "cancel-chain-entry",
               "select": "target",
               "requiredSkill": "scout" } }
  ```

- `offer-char-join-attack` -- under `on-event: creature-attack-begins`,
  raises a pending "may join the attacked company" offer for the
  bearer. The defender sees a `haven-join-attack` legal action during
  the assign-strikes cancel-window; accepting moves the bearer into
  the attacked company for this combat and (optionally) discards
  attached allies, forces a strike onto the bearer, and schedules
  post-attack side-effects. After combat finalizes the bearer is
  restored to their origin company. Composable flags:
  - `discardOwnedAllies` (boolean) -- discard allies attached to the
    bearer when they join.
  - `forceStrike` (boolean) -- at least one strike from the attacking
    creature must be assigned to the bearer before any other
    defender-side assignment is legal.
  - `postAttack` (object) -- effects applied at combat finalization
    regardless of outcome. Supports `tapIfUntapped` (boolean) and
    `corruptionCheck` (object with optional `modifier`).

  Implemented in `chain-reducer.ts`
  (`collectHavenJumpOffers()`), `legal-actions/combat.ts`
  (`havenJoinAttackActions()`), `reducer-combat.ts`
  (`handleHavenJoinAttack`, `applyPostAttackEffects`,
  `restoreHavenJumpOrigins`). Used by *Alatar* (tw-117).

### Pending resolutions

The engine carries two top-level lists alongside `phaseState`:

- **`pendingResolutions`** -- discrete pieces of work the engine has queued for a player to resolve before continuing (corruption checks, on-guard reveal windows, opponent-influence defensive rolls, etc.). The first entry whose `actor` matches the player computing legal actions collapses the menu to "resolve the top entry." Drains FIFO per actor; auto-swept at the matching scope boundary.
- **`activeConstraints`** -- scoped restrictions on the legal-action menu of some target (company / character / player). Filters but never blocks. Cross-player constraints are supported (e.g. *Stealth* — placed by the resource player, filtering the hazard player's plays).

Both lists are owned by `engine/pending.ts`; reducers and on-event handlers must go through the helpers (`enqueueResolution`, `addConstraint`, `sweepExpired`, etc.) rather than touching the lists directly.

### 9. `cancel-attack`

Cancels an entire attack against a company. Only playable during combat
before strikes are assigned. The source is normally a short event card
played from hand (and discarded), but the same effect type also covers
in-play "tap to cancel" abilities on allies.

When `cost` and `requiredSkill` are present, requires tapping a character
with the named skill (e.g. Concealment — tap a scout). When `cost` and
`requiredRace` are present, requires a character of that race in the
company — one action is generated per qualifying character. If the cost
is a corruption check (`"check": "corruption"`), the character need not
be untapped (e.g. Vanishment — wizard makes corruption check -2). When
both `requiredSkill` and `requiredRace` are absent, the card is simply
played with no additional cost (e.g. Dark Quarrels — cancel one attack
by Orcs, Trolls, or Men).

When the effect is declared on an in-play ally with
`cost: { "tap": "self" }`, the engine sources the ability from any
untapped ally with this effect attached to a character in the defending
company (e.g. The Warg-king's "tap to cancel a Wolf or Animal attack").
Activating taps the ally and cancels the attack immediately — no chain
entry is created.

A `when` condition filters which attacks qualify, evaluated against a
combat context that includes:

- `enemy.race` — the attacking creature's lowercase race (e.g. `"orc"`).
- `attack.keying` — array of region types the creature is keyed to
  (e.g. `["wilderness", "shadow"]`); only populated for creature hazards.
- `attack.source` — discriminates where the attack originated:
  `"creature"` (a hazard creature played during the movement/hazard
  phase — "not played at a site"), `"on-guard-creature"` (a creature
  placed on-guard at a site and revealed during the site phase), or
  `"automatic-attack"` (the site's own listed attack).
- `bearer.companySize` — the number of characters in the defending
  company (host company of an in-play ally or character source).
- `bearer.atHaven` — `true` when the defending company's current site
  is a haven. Used by Darkhaven-tap abilities (e.g. Adûnaphel the
  Ringwraith).

The effect may be declared on in-play sources too: an ally attached
to a company character (e.g. The Warg-king) or the character card
itself (e.g. Adûnaphel the Ringwraith). For in-play sources the cost
must be `cost: { "tap": "self" }` and the source must be untapped
when activated.

```json
{ "type": "cancel-attack",
  "cost": { "tap": "character" },
  "requiredSkill": "scout" }
{ "type": "cancel-attack",
  "requiredRace": "wizard",
  "cost": { "check": "corruption", "modifier": -2 } }
{ "type": "cancel-attack",
  "when": { "enemy.race": { "$in": ["orc", "troll", "men", "man"] } } }
{ "type": "cancel-attack",
  "cost": { "tap": "self" },
  "when": { "enemy.race": { "$in": ["wolf", "wolves", "animal", "animals"] } } }
{ "type": "cancel-attack",
  "cost": { "tap": "self" },
  "when": { "$and": [
    { "bearer.companySize": { "$lt": 3 } },
    { "$or": [
      { "attack.keying": "wilderness" },
      { "attack.keying": "shadow" } ] } ] } }
{ "type": "cancel-attack",
  "cost": { "tap": "self" },
  "when": { "$and": [
    { "bearer.atHaven": true },
    { "attack.source": "creature" } ] } }
```

### 9a. `wound-target-character`

Wounds the character targeted by a {@link PlayTargetEffect} on the same card
without a body check. Applied after the attack is cancelled when the chain entry
resolves. The targeted character's status is set to `inverted` (wounded). Used
with `cancel-attack` + `play-target` on cards whose text reads "playable on an
unwounded character facing an attack — the attack is cancelled and the character
is wounded (no body check required)".

The legal-action emitter generates one `cancel-attack` action per unwounded
character in the defending company (characters with `status !== inverted`).
The chosen character's instance ID is carried on the action as
`targetCharacterId` and preserved in the chain entry payload.

```json
{ "type": "wound-target-character" }
```

Example: Escape (tw-229) — cancel an attack against an unwounded character;
the character is wounded as the cost.

### 9b. `cancel-influence`

Automatically cancels an opponent's influence check against one of the
player's characters, followers, factions, allies, or items. Played from
hand during the opponent's site phase while an `opponent-influence-defend`
resolution is pending. The card is discarded after use.

When `requiredRace` is present, requires a character of that race under
the player's control. The `cost` is typically a corruption check with a
modifier that the cost-paying character must make after the cancellation.

```json
{ "type": "cancel-influence",
  "requiredRace": "wizard",
  "cost": { "check": "corruption", "modifier": -2 } }
```

### 9b. `halve-strikes`

Halves the number of strikes in the current attack (rounded up). Played
from hand as a short event during combat before strikes are assigned;
the card is discarded after use.

A `when` condition gates availability (e.g. requires a specific card
in play).

```json
{ "type": "halve-strikes",
  "when": { "inPlay": "Gates of Morning" } }
```

### 10. `dodge-strike`

Played from hand during strike resolution. The target character resolves
the strike at full prowess without tapping (unless wounded by the strike).
If wounded, a body penalty applies to the resulting body check.

```json
{ "type": "dodge-strike", "bodyPenalty": -1 }
```

The `bodyPenalty` modifies the character's body for the body check only
(negative values reduce body, making elimination more likely).

### 10a. `modify-strike`

Played from hand during strike resolution to modify the current strike's
prowess and/or body for one strike only. Unlike `dodge-strike`, the
character still taps normally (tap-to-fight / stay-untapped is
unaffected). Optionally gated by a skill requirement on the struck
character (e.g. "Warrior only").

```json
{ "type": "modify-strike",
  "prowessBonus": 3,
  "bodyPenalty": -1,
  "requiredSkill": "warrior" }
```

- `prowessBonus` — added to the character's prowess for the strike roll
  (may be negative). Omit for 0.
- `bodyPenalty` — added to the character's body on the resulting body
  check if wounded (typically negative). Omit for 0.
- `requiredSkill` — the struck character must carry this skill. Omit to
  allow any character.

Implemented in `engine/legal-actions/combat.ts` (emits a
`play-strike-event` action during resolve-strike) and
`engine/reducer-combat.ts` (discards the card and accumulates the
bonuses on the current {@link StrikeAssignment}).

### 10b. `reroll-strike`

Played from hand during strike resolution. Two 2d6 rolls are made and the
better total is used; the strike otherwise resolves exactly like a normal
tap-to-fight (full prowess, character taps on success/tie).

An optional `filter` condition gates availability on the strike target
character. It is evaluated against a `target.*` context carrying the
target's race, skills, and name (same context shape as `cancel-strike`'s
`filter`).

```json
{ "type": "reroll-strike",
  "filter": { "target.skills": { "$includes": "warrior" } } }
```

Example: Lucky Strike — warrior only; make two rolls against a strike
and choose one of the two results to use.

### 10c. `modify-attack`

Activated ability on an in-play item that modifies the whole attack (not a
single strike). Available to the defending player during the
pre-assignment window of combat (same window as `cancel-attack`). Tapping
the item adds `prowessModifier` to the creature's strike prowess and
`bodyModifier` to its body value, so every strike in the attack and the
creature body check are affected uniformly.

The cost must be `{ "tap": "self" }` — the item itself pays the cost. The
`when` clause gates availability (e.g. `bearer.skills` must include
`"warrior"` for a Warrior-only item). An optional `discardIfBearerNot`
lists the races whose bearers may tap the item safely; when the bearer's
race is not in the list the item is discarded instead of tapped (the
modifier still applies).

```json
{ "type": "modify-attack",
  "cost": { "tap": "self" },
  "prowessModifier": -1,
  "bodyModifier": -1,
  "when": { "bearer.skills": { "$includes": "warrior" } },
  "discardIfBearerNot": { "race": ["man", "dunadan"] } }
```

Example: Black Arrow (tw-494) — Warrior only, tap to give -1 prowess and
-1 body to one attack against the bearer's company; discard the arrow if
the bearer is not a Man.

Implemented in `engine/legal-actions/combat.ts` (`modifyAttackActions`)
and `engine/reducer-combat.ts` (`handleModifyAttack`).

### 10d. `item-tap-strike-bonus`

Activated ability on an in-play item that boosts the bearer's prowess for
the single strike currently being resolved. Unlike `modify-attack` (which
adjusts the creature's prowess for the whole attack, benefiting all
defenders), this effect targets only the bearer's specific strike assignment
and adds directly to `StrikeAssignment.strikeProwessBonus`. Available
during `resolve-strike` when the item is untapped and the bearer is the
current strike target.

The `cost` must be `{ "tap": "self" }`. An optional `when` gate is
evaluated against a context exposing `bearer.race`, `bearer.skills`,
`bearer.name`, and `enemy.race`.

```json
{ "type": "item-tap-strike-bonus",
  "cost": { "tap": "self" },
  "prowessBonus": 1 }
```

Example: Shield of Iron-bound Ash (tw-327) — tap to gain +1 prowess
against one strike.

Implemented in `engine/legal-actions/combat.ts` (`tapItemForStrikeActions`)
and `engine/reducer-combat.ts` (`handleTapItemForStrike`).

### 10e. `modify-attack-from-hand`

Played from hand as a short event during combat before strikes are
assigned; the card is discarded after use. Modifies the current attack's
strike prowess and/or creature body uniformly — same math as
`modify-attack`, but the source is a hand card rather than an in-play
item.

The `player` field selects which side plays the effect:

- `"attacker"` — the hazard player plays during their attack's
  pre-assignment window (e.g. Dragon's Desolation Mode A).
- `"defender"` — the resource player plays during the same window.

The `when` clause is evaluated against the standard combat context
(`enemy.race`, `attack.source`, `attack.keying`, `inPlay`).

```json
{ "type": "modify-attack-from-hand",
  "player": "attacker",
  "prowessModifier": 2,
  "when": { "enemy.race": "dragon" } }
```

Example: Dragon's Desolation (tw-29) Mode A — hazard short event; +2
strike prowess to one Dragon attack. Per CRF the card is playable even
against automatic-attacks and does not count against the hazard limit
(use `play-flag: no-hazard-limit`).

Implemented in `engine/legal-actions/combat.ts`
(`modifyAttackFromHandActions`) and `engine/reducer-combat.ts`
(`handleModifyAttackFromHand`).

### 11. `cancel-strike`

Pay a cost to cancel an incoming strike, with optional exclusions.

When `target` is absent or `"self"`, the bearer cancels their own strike
(e.g. The One Ring). When `target` is `"other-in-company"`, the character
taps to cancel a strike against another character in the same company
(e.g. Fatty Bolger). A `filter` condition selects which characters
qualify as valid protection targets.

The effect may be declared on an item attached to a character with
`cost: { "tap": "self" }`. Tapping the item cancels a strike against
its bearer; the `when` clause is evaluated against a context exposing
`bearer.skills`, `bearer.race`, `bearer.name`, and `enemy.race`, so
cards can gate the ability on the bearer's skill or race (e.g. Enruned
Shield — Warrior only). The item must be untapped when activated.

```json
{ "type": "cancel-strike",
  "cost": { "check": "corruption", "modifier": -2 },
  "when": { "$not": { "$or": [
    { "enemy.race": "undead" }, { "enemy.race": "nazgul" }
  ] } } }
{ "type": "cancel-strike",
  "cost": { "tap": "self" },
  "target": "other-in-company",
  "filter": { "target.race": "hobbit" } }
{ "type": "cancel-strike",
  "cost": { "tap": "self" },
  "when": { "bearer.skills": { "$includes": "warrior" } } }
```

### 12. Combat-rule effects

Each combat-mechanics override is a distinct effect type. The chain
reducer dispatches on the effect's `type`, so adding a new override is a
one-line union extension plus the matching branch — no opaque rule
strings to chase through the engine.

- `combat-attacker-chooses-defenders` — the attacking player assigns
  strikes instead of the defender (implemented in `chain-reducer.ts`)
- `combat-multi-attack` — the creature makes multiple separate attacks,
  all against the same target character. The `count` field specifies how
  many attacks. Total strikes = count × effective strikes per attack.
  All strikes are auto-assigned to the attacker's chosen target.
  (implemented in `chain-reducer.ts`, `reducer-combat.ts`)
- `combat-cancel-attack-by-tap` — the defending player may tap non-target
  characters in the company to cancel attacks. The `maxCancels` field
  specifies the maximum number of attacks that can be canceled this way.
  (implemented in `reducer-combat.ts`, `legal-actions/combat.ts`)
- `combat-one-strike-per-character` — the creature makes one strike per
  character in the defending company (`strikesTotal =
  company.characters.length`), overriding the card's raw `strikes` value.
  Card text is "Each character in the company faces one strike". Mutually
  exclusive with `combat-multi-attack`. (implemented in `chain-reducer.ts`)
- `combat-detainment` — marks the attack as detainment (CoE §3.II).
  Detainment strikes tap the character instead of wounding/eliminating,
  suppress the character body check (rule 3.II.1), do not trigger
  `on-wounded` passives (rule 3.II.1.1), and zero kill-MP for the
  defeated creature (rule 3.II.3 — discarded instead of routed to the
  attacked player's kill pile). Accepts the shared optional `when`
  clause, evaluated against `{ defender: { alignment, covert } }` at
  combat-initiation time; use it to express card text like "detainment
  against hero companies" or "detainment against covert and hero
  companies". (implemented in `engine/detainment.ts`,
  `reducer-combat.ts`)

```json
{ "type": "combat-attacker-chooses-defenders" }
{ "type": "combat-multi-attack", "count": 3 }
{ "type": "combat-cancel-attack-by-tap", "maxCancels": 2 }
{ "type": "combat-one-strike-per-character" }
{ "type": "combat-detainment" }
{
  "type": "combat-detainment",
  "when": {
    "$or": [
      { "defender.alignment": "hero" },
      {
        "$and": [
          { "defender.alignment": "fallen-wizard" },
          { "defender.covert": true }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 13. `play-restriction`

Constrains when or where a card can enter play.

```json
{ "type": "play-restriction", "rule": "home-site-only",
  "when": { "$not": { "reason": "starting-character" } } }
```

### 14. `duplication-limit`

Caps how many copies of this card can be in a given scope.

Supported scopes:

- `"character"` — one copy per character (e.g. Horn of Anor).
- `"site"` — one copy per site across all companies at the site (e.g. Rescue Prisoners).
- `"game"` — one copy anywhere in play across both players.
- `"player"` — one copy per player across all their characters (e.g. The Windlord Found Me).

```json
{ "type": "duplication-limit", "scope": "character", "max": 1 }
{ "type": "duplication-limit", "scope": "player", "max": 1 }
```

### 15. `play-target`

Declares what this card targets when played. The engine uses this to
generate per-target actions (one per eligible character, company, etc.).

Character targeting is driven entirely by the DSL: the coarse `target`
category picks the scope (each character in scope is a candidate) and
an optional `filter` {@link Condition} refines it further. The filter
is evaluated against the per-candidate context
`{ target: { race, status, skills, name, inAvatarCompany, itemKeywords }, company: { skills } }`, so there are no
card-specific target keywords in the engine — a card declares its
audience directly via a condition expression.

```json
{ "type": "play-target", "target": "character" }
{ "type": "play-target", "target": "character",
  "filter": { "target.race": "hobbit" } }
{ "type": "play-target", "target": "character",
  "filter": {
    "$and": [
      { "target.skills": { "$includes": "scout" } },
      { "target.status": "untapped" }
    ]
  },
  "maxCompanySize": 2,
  "cost": { "tap": "character" } }
```

Supported targets:

- `character` — each character in scope is a candidate. Resource-side
  plays implicitly scope to the active player's own characters; hazard
  plays scope to the active company's characters. Also applied on
  **items** to gate which characters may bear them (e.g. Wizard's Staff
  filters to `target.race: "wizard"`): the site-phase item legal-action
  emitter evaluates the filter per-candidate bearer and only offers
  `play-hero-resource` actions for matching characters.
- `company` — the active company (e.g. Lost in Free-domains).
- `site` — the company's destination/current site (e.g. River).

Optional fields:

- `filter` — DSL condition restricting which candidates qualify. When
  absent every candidate in scope qualifies.
- `maxCompanySize` — maximum effective company size for eligibility
  (hobbits count as half). Used alongside the filter to enforce size
  limits (e.g. Stealth).
- `cost` — cost paid when the card resolves. Evaluated by `cost-evaluator.ts`
  via `applyCost`; the same cost shapes are available on every effect type:
  - `{ "tap": "character" }` — taps the targeted character (e.g. Stealth taps
    the targeted scout). The engine emits one `play-short-event` per eligible
    untapped target.
  - `{ "tap": "bearer" }` — taps the character bearing the source card.
  - `{ "tap": "self" }` — taps the source card itself (item/ally/character).
  - `{ "tap": "sage-in-company" }` — one untapped sage in the company taps;
    one action per eligible sage.
  - `{ "discard": "self" }` — detaches and discards the source card.
  - `{ "check": "corruption", "modifier": N }` — the actor makes a corruption
    check modified by N (e.g. One Ring, Vanishment, Wizard's Laughter).
  - `{ "wound": "bearer" | "character" | "self" }` — wounds the specified
    entity (sets status to Inverted) as the cost.

### 16. `on-guard-reveal`

Declares when an on-guard card may be revealed during the site phase.
The `trigger` field specifies the game event that allows the reveal.

```json
{ "type": "on-guard-reveal", "trigger": "influence-attempt" }
```

Supported triggers:

- `influence-attempt` — when a character in the company declares an
  influence attempt (faction play)
- `resource-play` — when the resource player plays any resource that
  taps the site (generic catch-all)

### 19. `site-rule`

Declares a site-specific rule that modifies standard game mechanics
when a company is at this site.

```json
{ "type": "site-rule", "rule": "healing-affects-all" }
{ "type": "site-rule", "rule": "deny-item",
  "when": { "subtype": "greater",
            "name": { "$ne": "Scroll of Isildur" } } }
```

Rules:

- `healing-affects-all` — wounded characters at this site heal during untap
  as if the site were a haven
- `deny-item` — any item whose card definition matches the `when` condition
  cannot be played at this site. The condition is a standard DSL condition
  (MongoDB-style, evaluated against the item card definition), so arbitrary
  combinations of subtype, name, keywords, etc. are supported. Implemented
  in `legal-actions/site.ts` play-resources step — e.g. Tolfalas uses this
  to deny every greater item except Scroll of Isildur.
- `cancel-attacks` — hazard-creature plays targeting a company whose
  effective site (destination if moving, else current) is this site are
  marked non-viable. Used by darkhavens and the fallen-wizard haven
  (Dol Guldur, Minas Morgul, Carn Dûm, The White Towers, Moria, The
  Under-gates). Implemented in `legal-actions/movement-hazard.ts`
  play-hazards step.
- `auto-test-gold-ring` — storing a gold-ring item at this site enqueues
  a `gold-ring-test` pending resolution with the rule's `rollModifier`.
  The gold-ring-test handler rolls 2d6 + modifier, logs the outcome,
  and discards the ring regardless of result (Rule 9.21 / 9.22).
  Requires that the gold-ring item also declares `storable-at` for the
  site. Rule 9.21's replacement-with-special-ring step is not yet
  implemented.

  ```json
  { "type": "site-rule", "rule": "auto-test-gold-ring", "rollModifier": -2 }
  ```

- `attacks-not-detainment` — forces attacks against a company at this
  site to be resolved as normal attacks rather than detainment,
  overriding the default CoE §3.II.2 R1/R2/R3 and B1/B2/B3 rules and
  any keying-based detainment. The optional `filter` is a standard DSL
  condition evaluated against `{ enemy: { race } }`; the override only
  applies when the attacking creature matches. A missing filter applies
  the override to every attack at the site. Consumed by
  `engine/detainment.ts` (both hazard-creature and automatic-attack call
  sites). Used by *Moria* (le-392) and its twin shadow-holds whose text
  reads "non-Nazgûl creatures played at this site attack normally, not
  as detainment."

  ```json
  { "type": "site-rule", "rule": "attacks-not-detainment",
    "filter": { "enemy.race": { "$ne": "nazgul" } } }
  ```

- `deny-character` — during the organization phase, characters whose card
  definition matches the `filter` cannot be brought into play at this site.
  When `exceptHomesite: true`, the rule is waived for a character whose
  `homesite` equals this site's name. Consumed by
  `legal-actions/organization-characters.ts` — the matching sites are
  simply excluded from the character's playable sites (and thus from
  `play-character` legal actions, covering both general-influence and
  direct-influence follower plays). Used by Carn Dûm (le-359): "Unless
  this site is a character's home site, a non-Orc, non-Troll character
  may not be brought into play at this site."

  ```json
  { "type": "site-rule", "rule": "deny-character",
    "filter": { "$not": { "race": { "$in": ["orc", "troll"] } } },
    "exceptHomesite": true }
  ```

- `never-taps` — the site's status never transitions to `Tapped`. The two
  normal tap-sites — a resource (item/ally) being played on a character at
  this site, and an influence attempt resolving at this site — both skip
  the tap when this rule is present. Characters, items, and influencing
  characters still tap as usual; only the site itself is unaffected.
  Consumed by `engine/reducer-site.ts`. Used by *The Worthy Hills*
  (le-415): "This site never taps."

  ```json
  { "type": "site-rule", "rule": "never-taps" }
  ```

- `heal-during-untap` — treats the site as a haven for the untap phase
  only: wounded (inverted) characters at this site heal to tapped as
  they would at a haven. Nothing else about the site (site-type,
  hazard-limit, attack rules, storage rules, …) is affected. Consumed
  by `engine/reducer-untap.ts` during `performUntap`. Used by *Barad-dûr*
  (le-352) — "Treat this site as a Darkhaven during the untap phase."

  ```json
  { "type": "site-rule", "rule": "heal-during-untap" }
  ```

- `dynamic-auto-attack` — when a company enters this site, the opponent
  may play one hazard creature from hand as the site's automatic-attack.
  The `keying` filter lists the site-types and region-types that satisfy
  the creature's keying; a creature is eligible iff at least one of its
  `keyedTo` entries names a matching siteType or regionType. The played
  creature attacks with its own prowess/strikes/body and is discarded
  after combat regardless of outcome (no kill-MP, matching standard
  auto-attack semantics). Consumed by `engine/reducer-site.ts` and
  `engine/legal-actions/site.ts` through the new `play-site-auto-attack`
  site-phase step. Used by *Framsburg* (td-175).

  ```json
  { "type": "site-rule", "rule": "dynamic-auto-attack",
    "keying": {
      "siteTypes": ["ruins-and-lairs", "shadow-hold"],
      "regionTypes": ["wilderness", "shadow"]
    } }
  ```

### 20. `item-play-site`

Restricts an item to be playable only where the company's current site
satisfies a constraint. Two mutually-exclusive forms:

- `sites`: site name must appear in the list (e.g. Palantír of Orthanc —
  Isengard only).
- `filter`: a generic site-card condition evaluated against
  `{ site: <site definition> }` (e.g. hoard items: any site whose
  definition has `hoard: true`).

When present, the normal site-type check (`playableResources`) is
bypassed; the item is playable only if its restriction matches.
Implemented in `legal-actions/site.ts`.

```json
{ "type": "item-play-site", "sites": ["Isengard"] }
```

```json
{ "type": "item-play-site", "filter": { "site.hoard": true } }
```

### 21. `storable-at`

Declares that an item can be stored during the Organization phase when
the bearer's company is at a matching site. Storing moves the item from
the character to the player's stored-items pile, where it earns
marshalling points safely. After storage the initial bearer makes a
corruption check.

A site matches if its name is in `sites` OR its `siteType` is in
`siteTypes`. At least one of the two lists must be present. `sites`
targets specific sites (e.g. Minas Tirith); `siteTypes` targets a whole
class (e.g. any Haven).

When `marshallingPoints` is present, the stored item uses that value
instead of the card's base MP. Implemented in
`legal-actions/organization-companies.ts` (legal action),
`reducer-organization.ts` (handler), and `recompute-derived.ts` (MP).

```json
{ "type": "storable-at", "sites": ["Minas Tirith"], "marshallingPoints": 2 }
{ "type": "storable-at", "siteTypes": ["haven"], "marshallingPoints": 1 }
```

### 22. `company-rule`

Declares a company-level rule carried by a character. While this character
is in play, the rule applies to their entire company.

```json
{ "type": "company-rule", "rule": "healing-affects-all" }
```

Rules:

- `healing-affects-all` — when a healing effect (e.g. `set-character-status`
  from inverted to untapped) targets a character in this character's company,
  the healing extends to all wounded characters in the company. Implemented in
  `reducer-events.ts` (play-option healing spread). Example: Ioreth.

### 23. `call-of-home-check`

Forces a "Call of Home" style roll check on the targeted character. When
the hazard short event resolves against a character (selected via
`play-target`), the character's player rolls 2d6. If roll + unused
general influence < `threshold`, the character returns to the player's
hand. All items, allies, and hazards attached to the character are
discarded; followers fall to GI if room, otherwise are discarded.

Used with a `play-target` effect that selects the target character.

```json
{ "type": "call-of-home-check", "threshold": 10 }
```

Implemented in `chain-reducer.ts` (enqueue pending resolution on
short-event resolution), `legal-actions/pending.ts` (generate roll
action), and `pending-reducers.ts` (execute roll and apply consequences).

### 24. `mass-body-check`

Forces a body check modified by `modifier` (typically negative) on **every
character** in the active company when the hazard short event resolves. For
each character the resource player rolls 2d6:

- Roll ≥ (body + modifier): no effect.
- Roll < (body + modifier), character is Orc or Troll: character returned to
  hand (discarded per normal body-check rules for Orcs/Trolls).
- Roll < (body + modifier), character is any other race, untapped: character
  becomes tapped.
- Roll < (body + modifier), character is any other race, already tapped: no
  effect.

```json
{ "type": "mass-body-check", "modifier": -1 }
```

Implemented in `chain-reducer.ts` (detect effect on short-event resolution,
enqueue one `body-check-company` pending resolution per character),
`legal-actions/pending.ts` (generate `body-check-company-roll` action per
queued resolution), and `pending-reducers.ts` (execute roll, apply
race-based consequence, resume chain auto-resolution after all checks
resolve).

### Grant-Action: `palantir-fetch-discard`

Tap the Palantír item to choose one card from the player's discard pile
and shuffle it into the play deck. Bearer makes a corruption check after
the fetch resolves. Requires the bearer to be able to use a Palantír
(Saruman's innate ability or Align Palantír attached) and at least 5
cards in the play deck.

```json
{ "type": "grant-action", "action": "palantir-fetch-discard",
  "cost": { "tap": "self" },
  "when": { "$and": [
    { "bearer.canUsePalantir": true },
    { "player.playDeckSize": { "$gte": 5 } }
  ] } }
```

Context variables for grant-action `when` conditions:

- `bearer.canUsePalantir` — true if the bearer's card text includes
  palantír-use ability or has Align Palantír attached
- `player.playDeckSize` — number of cards in the player's play deck

Implemented in `reducer-organization.ts` (handler), `legal-actions/organization.ts`
(scanner + context), `reducer-utils.ts` (fetch completion with corruption check).

### 23. `play-condition`

Gates playability on a game-state condition. The `requires` field names
the context source.

Requires:

- `site-path` — the company's resolved site path during M/H. The
  condition is evaluated against a context exposing:
  - `sitePath.*Count` — region-type counts from the resolved site path
    (`wildernessCount`, `shadowCount`, `darkCount`, `coastalCount`,
    `freeCount`, `borderCount`).
  - `destinationSiteType` — the site type of the destination
    (`ruins-and-lairs`, `shadow-hold`, etc.), enabling cards that gate
    on both path composition and destination site type (e.g. Dragon's
    Desolation tw-29 Mode B: R&L destination + 2W in path).
  - `inPlay` — names of all cards currently in play, matching the
    shared `inPlay` condition semantics (e.g. *Doors of Night* as an
    alt-keying relaxation).

```json
{ "type": "play-condition", "requires": "site-path",
  "condition": {
    "$or": [
      { "sitePath.wildernessCount": { "$gte": 2 } },
      { "sitePath.shadowCount": { "$gte": 1 } },
      { "sitePath.darkCount": { "$gte": 1 } }
    ]
  } }
```

Implemented in `legal-actions/movement-hazard.ts` (`checkSitePathCondition`).

- `discard-named-card` — requires discarding a specific named card as a
  play prerequisite. The `cardName` field names the card, and `sources`
  lists where to look: `character-items` (items on characters at the
  current site) and/or `out-of-play-pile` (stored items in the player's
  out-of-play pile). One legal action is generated per available discard
  candidate, carrying the `discardCardInstanceId` on the action.

```json
{ "type": "play-condition", "requires": "discard-named-card",
  "cardName": "Sapling of the White Tree",
  "sources": ["character-items", "out-of-play-pile"] }
```

Implemented in `legal-actions/site.ts` (permanent event play-condition
check) and `reducer-events.ts` (discard execution).

### 24. `creature-race-choice`

Requires the player to choose a creature race when playing the card.
The `exclude` array lists races that may not be chosen. The legal-action
emitter produces one `play-hazard` action per eligible race, each
carrying the chosen race on `chosenCreatureRace`. The `apply` clause
describes the constraint added for the chosen race.

When `fixedRace` is present no choice is offered: a single action is
emitted with that race and the apply resolves directly. Used by
Dragon's Desolation (tw-29) Mode B — always Dragon.

Supported `apply.constraint` values:

- `creature-type-no-hazard-limit` — creatures of the chosen race played
  against the target company do not count against the hazard limit for
  the constraint's scope (e.g. Two or Three Tribes Present).
- `creature-keying-bypass` — ONE creature of the chosen race may be
  played on the target company ignoring its normal keying. The
  constraint carries a `remainingPlays` counter (default 1); each
  creature of that race played against this company consumes one
  charge, and the constraint clears at zero. The M/H legal-action
  emitter treats a matching bypass as an extra `keyedBy` method
  (`keying-bypass`) when path-based keying fails (Dragon's Desolation
  tw-29 Mode B).

```json
{ "type": "creature-race-choice",
  "exclude": ["nazgul", "undead", "dragon"],
  "apply": {
    "type": "add-constraint",
    "constraint": "creature-type-no-hazard-limit",
    "scope": "company-mh-phase"
  } }
```

```json
{ "type": "creature-race-choice",
  "exclude": [],
  "fixedRace": "dragon",
  "apply": {
    "type": "add-constraint",
    "constraint": "creature-keying-bypass",
    "scope": "company-mh-phase"
  } }
```

Implemented in `legal-actions/movement-hazard.ts` (action generation,
`hasCreatureKeyingBypass`, keying-bypass fallthrough),
`reducer-movement-hazard.ts` (constraint creation + consumption via
`consumeCreatureKeyingBypass`).

### 25. `ahunt-attack`

Declares that while this hazard long-event is in play, any company whose
movement path crosses the listed region names (or region types) faces a
creature-like attack during the order-effects step (CoE step 4). The
attack uses the specified strikes, prowess, body, and race. Combat rules
(e.g. `attacker-chooses-defenders`) are declared in `combatRules`.

The optional `extended` clause adds extra region names and/or region
types when a condition is met (typically Doors of Night in play).

```json
{ "type": "ahunt-attack",
  "regionNames": ["Andrast Coast", "Bay of Belfalas", "Eriadoran Coast", "Andrast"],
  "strikes": 3,
  "prowess": 15,
  "body": 6,
  "race": "dragon",
  "combatRules": ["attacker-chooses-defenders"],
  "extended": {
    "when": { "inPlay": "Doors of Night" },
    "regionNames": ["Old Pûkel-land", "Enedhwaith", "Anfalas"],
    "regionTypes": ["coastal-sea"]
  } }
```

Implemented in `reducer-movement-hazard.ts` (`handleOrderEffects`,
`collectMatchingAhuntAttacks`).

### 26. `call-council`

Triggers the "call the council" endgame transition from a card, as the
card-based equivalent of the `call-free-council` action. Used by Sudden
Call (le-235) per CoE rule 10.41: Ringwraith and Balrog players cannot
freely call the endgame and must play Sudden Call instead.

```json
{ "type": "call-council", "lastTurnFor": "opponent" }
{ "type": "call-council", "lastTurnFor": "self" }
```

- `lastTurnFor: "opponent"` — resource-side play on the card-player's
  own turn; the opponent gets one last turn.
- `lastTurnFor: "self"` — hazard-side play during the opponent's turn;
  the card-player gets one last turn.

Both modes set `freeCouncilCalled` on the caller, advance the turn, and
set `state.lastTurnFor` accordingly. Implemented in `reducer-end-of-turn.ts`
(`triggerCouncilCall`).

### 27. `move`

Generic card-movement primitive. A `move` picks card instance(s) by
selector, removes them from a source zone, and appends them to a
destination zone. Implemented in `engine/reducer-move.ts`
(`applyMove`).

Replaces the eleven per-move effect types that existed before the
card-move plan (`specs/2026-04-23-card-move-primitive-plan.md`). The
following table shows the old types and their current `move` shapes
for reference:

| Old effect | New shape | Example card |
|---|---|---|
| `discard-self` | `{ select: 'self', from: 'self-location', to: 'discard' }` | Treebeard, Align Palantír |
| `discard-target-item` | `{ select: 'target', from: 'in-play', to: 'discard' }` | Gandalf's test-gold-ring |
| `discard-named-card-from-company` | `{ select: 'named', from: 'in-play', to: 'discard', cardName }` | Stinker / Gollum |
| `move-target-from-discard-to-hand` | `{ select: 'target', from: 'discard', to: 'hand', filter }` | Saruman |
| `discard-in-play` | `{ select: 'target', from: 'in-play', to: 'discard', filter }` | Marvels Told |
| `discard-cards-in-play` | `{ select: 'filter-all', from: 'in-play', to: 'discard', filter }` | Doors of Night |
| `discard-non-special-items` | `{ select: 'filter-all', from: 'items-on-wounded', to: 'discard', toOwner: 'defender', filter }` | creature wound triggers |
| `reshuffle-self-from-hand` | `{ select: 'self', from: 'hand', to: 'deck', shuffleAfter: true }` | Sudden Call |
| `fetch-to-deck` | `{ select: 'target', from: ['sideboard','discard'], to: 'deck', shuffleAfter: true, filter, count }` | Smoke Rings |
| `bounce-hazard-events` | `{ select: 'filter-all', from: 'attached-to-target-company', to: 'hand', toOwner: 'opponent', filter, corruptionCheck }` | Wizard Uncloaked |

**Shape**

```json
{
  "type": "move",
  "select": "self | target | filter-all | named",
  "from": "<MoveZone> | [<MoveZone>, …]",
  "to": "<MoveZone>",
  "toOwner": "source-owner | opponent | defender",
  "filter": { "…": "…" },
  "count": 1,
  "shuffleAfter": false,
  "corruptionCheck": { "modifier": 0 },
  "cardName": "…"
}
```

**Selectors**

- `self` — the card carrying the effect; the engine locates it wherever
  it currently lives (hand, discard, cardsInPlay, attached to a character).
- `target` — the user-selected target carried on the triggering action
  (`action.targetCardId`). Must be found in one of the declared `from`
  zones.
- `filter-all` — every instance in the declared `from` zones whose
  definition matches `filter`. `count` optionally caps the result.
- `named` — the first instance whose definition name equals `cardName`.

**Zones (`MoveZone`)**

Named piles: `hand`, `deck`, `discard`, `sideboard`, `out-of-play`,
`kill-pile`. Contextual locators: `self-location` (wherever the source
card lives), `in-play` (any player's `cardsInPlay`),
`items-on-target` (items on the action's target character),
`items-on-wounded` (items on the combat-wounded character),
`attached-to-target-company` (items + hazards attached to any character
in the target company).

Contextual locators are introduced by the migration phase that first
uses them — not all are available in Phase 1.

**Destination owner**

- `source-owner` (default) — push to the pile of whoever owned the
  source instance.
- `opponent` — push to the other player's pile (bounce).
- `defender` — combat context; push to the defender's pile
  (wound-triggered item loss).

**Side effects**

- `shuffleAfter: true` shuffles the destination pile after pushing.
- `corruptionCheck: { modifier: n }` enqueues a corruption check on
  the bearer after the move resolves.

## Resolver Architecture

The engine calls a resolver at each decision point:

```text
resolve(context, stat) → final value
```

The context carries everything relevant to the current calculation:

- `reason` — what is being calculated (`"combat"`, `"faction-influence-check"`, `"corruption-check"`, etc.)
- `bearer` / `character` — the character involved
- `enemy` — the creature or hazard (in combat)
- `faction` — the faction (in influence checks). Exposes `faction.name`, `faction.race`, and `faction.playableAt` — an array of the sites/site-types listed on the faction card's `playableAt`, enabling conditions like `{ "faction.playableAt": "Dunnish Clan-hold" }` (AS-4 Perchen).
- `company` — all characters at the same site
- `cardsInPlay` — all cards in play for both players
- `inPlay` — names of all events/cards in play (for `target: "all-attacks"` and `"all-characters"` contexts)
- `controller.inPlay` — names of cards in play controlled by the player performing the check (populated during faction-influence checks). Use this when an effect depends on the *same* player controlling another card, e.g. Standard Modifications like "Grey Mountain Goblins (+2)" on LE factions, which apply only when the controller has both factions in play: `{ "when": { "controller.inPlay": "Grey Mountain Goblins" } }`.
- `enemy.race` — the creature's race (for `target: "all-attacks"` contexts, e.g. `"wolf"`, `"orc"`)

The resolver:

1. Collects all effects from all cards in play
2. Filters by `when` conditions against the context
3. Resolves `overrides` chains (specific beats general)
4. Evaluates value expressions via MathJS with context variables
5. Applies modifiers and caps
6. Returns the final computed value

## Full Card Examples

### Alatar

```json
"effects": [
  { "type": "draw-modifier", "draw": "hazard", "value": -1, "min": 0 },
  { "type": "on-event", "event": "creature-attack-begins",
    "apply": {
      "type": "offer-char-join-attack",
      "discardOwnedAllies": true,
      "forceStrike": true,
      "postAttack": { "tapIfUntapped": true, "corruptionCheck": {} }
    } }
]
```

Reduces opponent draws from Alatar's company's movement by one (floored at zero). When a hazard creature attacks any of the controller's companies and Alatar is at a haven in a different company, the controller may accept the haven-join offer: Alatar joins the attacked company for this combat, his attached allies are discarded, the creature must strike him, and after combat he taps (if untapped) and makes a corruption check. He returns to the haven company at combat finalization.

### Halfling Strength

"effects": [
  { "type": "play-target", "target": "character",

               "check": "corruption",
               "scope": "until-cleared", "value": 4 } }
]
```

`play-option` declares one of several mutually-exclusive choices the
player may take when playing a card. Each option has an `id`, an optional
`when` evaluated against the target context (`target.race`,
`target.status`, `target.skills`, `inPlay`), and an `apply` clause
resolved by the generic reducer.

The `when` context includes `inPlay` — an array of all card names
currently in play — so conditions like `{ "inPlay": "Gates of Morning" }`
work.

Supported `apply` kinds today:

- `set-character-status` — mutates the target character's status
  (`tapped` / `untapped` / `inverted`). Untap and heal both map here.
- `add-constraint` — attaches an {@link ActiveConstraint} to the target.
  When `constraint: "check-modifier"` is used, the constraint behaves as
  a one-shot bonus (`check`, `value`) to the target's next check of the
  named type, consumed automatically on resolution. Future cards granting
  one-shot bonuses to influence or other checks reuse the same kind
  unchanged. When `constraint: "hazard-limit-modifier"` is used, the
  target is resolved to the company containing the targeted character and
  the constraint modifies the hazard limit during the company's M/H phase.
  The `scope` should be `"company-mh-phase"`.

### Choking Shadows

Three `on-event: company-arrives-at-site` modes tried in order; the first
whose `when` matches is the mode that applies. Modes B1/B2 require
*Doors of Night* in play and can rewrite the destination site or region
type until end of turn; Mode A is the fallback +2 prowess boost applied
to the next automatic-attack at a Ruins & Lairs site.

```

### 28. `control-restriction`

Restricts how the bearer character can be controlled.

Rules:

- `no-direct-influence` — the character cannot be controlled by direct
  influence. On attachment, any existing DI control is reverted to general
  influence. During organization, the character cannot be moved to DI.
  Used by Rebel-talk (le-132). Implemented in `chain-reducer.ts`
  (attachment revert) and `organization-companies.ts` (block
  move-to-influence).

```json
{ "type": "control-restriction", "rule": "no-direct-influence" }
```

### 30. `dragon-at-home`

Augments a Dragon's lair with an additional automatic-attack while this
"At-Home" permanent-event is in play. The carrying card's `manifestId`
identifies which Dragon — the lair is found by matching `lairOf`. The
augmentation is suppressed for as long as the same Dragon's Ahunt
long-event is also in play (the rule's "Unless [Dragon] Ahunt is in
play" clause).

```json
{ "type": "dragon-at-home",
  "attack": { "creatureType": "Dragon", "strikes": 2, "prowess": 18 } }
```

Implemented in `engine/manifestations.ts` (`getActiveAutoAttacks`).

### 31. `ward-bearer`

Attaches a "cancels hazard X" ward to the bearer of the card carrying
this effect (an item on a character, typically). The `filter` is a
standard DSL condition evaluated against each *hazard* card definition;
any hazard whose definition matches the filter is:

- **On-entry swept**: when the ward-bearing card attaches to a character,
  every hazard already on that character whose definition matches is
  discarded to the hazard owner's discard pile.
- **Continuously cancelled**: while the ward-bearing card remains on the
  character, any hazard permanent-event that would attach to the
  character is routed to its owner's discard pile instead. The
  movement/hazard legal-action computer also suppresses the character
  as a play target for matching hazards, so the hazard player never
  sees a pointless "attach" offer in the first place.

```json
{ "type": "ward-bearer",
  "filter": { "keywords": { "$includes": "dark-enchantment" } } }
```

Used by Adamant Helmet (td-96) — "Cancels all dark enchantments
targetting bearer." Implemented in `engine/effects/ward.ts` with call
sites in `engine/reducer-site.ts` (`handleSitePlayHeroResource`),
`engine/chain-reducer.ts` (`resolvePermanentEvent`), and
`engine/legal-actions/movement-hazard.ts` (character-target emission).

### 32. Combat-time permanent-event play

A hazard permanent-event can declare `play-window` with `phase:
"combat"` and `step: "resolve-strike"` to be offered during combat
instead of the movement/hazard phase. The combat legal-action emitter
in `engine/legal-actions/combat.ts` (`combatHazardPermanentPlays`)
picks up matching cards in the attacker's hand and offers a
`play-hazard` action against the defender currently facing the strike.

`play-condition` with `requires: "combat-creature-race"` and a
`race` field gates the play on the attacking creature's race (read
from `combat.creatureRace`). A standard `play-target` with a
character filter further refines which defenders the card may be
played on.

A companion `on-event` with trigger `"self-enters-play-combat"` and
apply `{ type: "modify-current-strike-prowess", value: -1 }` adjusts
the current strike's prowess at play time. The engine encodes a -1 to
the attacker's strike as a +1 bonus on the defender's
`StrikeAssignment.strikeProwessBonus`, so it integrates with the
existing per-strike prowess machinery.

```json
{ "type": "play-window", "phase": "combat", "step": "resolve-strike" }
{ "type": "play-condition", "requires": "combat-creature-race", "race": "dragon" }
{ "type": "on-event", "event": "self-enters-play-combat",
  "apply": { "type": "modify-current-strike-prowess", "value": -1 } }
```

Used by Dragon's Curse (td-16). The movement/hazard legal-action
emitter skips cards whose `play-window.phase` is not
`"movement-hazard"`, so a combat-tagged hazard is not accidentally
offered during the M/H phase.

### 33. `combat-protection`

Protects the bearing card (typically an ally) from being assigned
strikes during combat. Only `protection: "no-attack"` is defined.

When an ally carries this effect, it is excluded from the
strike-assignment pool for both the defending player (defender's choice
of who takes each strike) and the attacking player (who assigns
remaining or excess strikes). The ally remains in the company and can
still tap for other purposes (e.g. cancel-attack).

```json
{ "type": "combat-protection", "protection": "no-attack" }
```

Used by Goldberry (tw-245) — "May not be attacked." Implemented in
`engine/legal-actions/combat.ts` (`allyHasCombatProtection()`),
checked in both the defender-assigns and attacker-assigns loops.

### 34. `auto-attack-race-duplicate`

When this effect appears on a permanent hazard event in `cardsInPlay`,
every automatic-attack of the specified `race` at the active company's
site must be faced a second time after all regular automatic-attacks
are resolved. The duplication uses the same modified prowess and strikes
(including all in-play modifiers) as the original attack.

Fields:
- `race: string` — lowercase race to match (e.g. `"undead"`). Matched
  against `normalizeCreatureRace(aa.creatureType)` for each auto-attack.

Implementation: `reducer-site.ts` `handleSiteAutomaticAttacks()`. After
all regular attacks are resolved, the handler scans every player's
`cardsInPlay` for this effect type, collects matching auto-attacks, and
processes them one per `pass` action (ordered by their original index).
The counter `duplicatesRun = automaticAttacksResolved - autoAttacks.length`
tracks how many race-based duplicates have been initiated; this count
grows naturally with `automaticAttacksResolved`. Race-based duplicates
are processed before any `auto-attack-duplicate` constraint (Incite Defenders).

Used by *The Moon Is Dead* (dm-71):

```json
{ "type": "auto-attack-race-duplicate", "race": "undead" }
```

### 35. `trigger-attack-on-play`

When present on a resource permanent event, the company immediately
faces an automatic attack of the given type after the card attaches to
its bearer character. The attack flows through the normal combat
sub-system. At combat finalization:

- If **all characters in the company are tapped**, the card is
  discarded from the bearer's items and the play has no lasting effect.
- If **any character remains untapped**, the bearer is tapped and
  gains a `bearer-cannot-untap` active constraint (scoped
  `until-cleared`). The constraint is swept when the item is stored
  via `store-item` during the organization phase.

Fields:
- `creatureType: string` — e.g. `"Spider"`. Normalised with
  `normalizeCreatureRace()` for combat-modifier lookups.
- `strikes: number` — number of strikes the attack delivers.
- `prowess: number` — prowess of each strike.

Implementation: `chain-reducer.ts` `resolvePermanentEvent()` detects
the effect and sets `state.combat` with an `attackSource` of type
`card-triggered-attack`. `reducer-combat.ts` `finalizeCombat()` handles the
discard-or-keep logic and adds the `bearer-cannot-untap` constraint.
`reducer-untap.ts` `performUntap()` skips characters with an active
`bearer-cannot-untap` constraint. `reducer-organization.ts`
`handleStoreItem()` sweeps matching constraints when the card is stored.

Used by *Rescue Prisoners* (tw-315):

```json
{ "type": "trigger-attack-on-play", "creatureType": "Spider", "strikes": 2, "prowess": 7 }
```

### 36. `force-return-to-origin`

Tags a hazard long-event (environment) whose resolution causes any moving
company satisfying the optional `condition` to return to its site of origin.

This tag is **consumed by the chain engine** (not an enforcement mechanism
itself): when an ally with `cancel-chain-return-to-origin` looks for valid
targets, it matches unresolved chain entries whose source card carries this
effect. The actual enforcement of the return is handled separately in the
order-effects resolution path (rule-5.31, currently `test.todo`).

Fields:
- `condition?: Condition` — evaluated against company site-path context
  (`sitePath.wildernessCount`, `sitePath.shadowCount`, `sitePath.darkCount`,
  etc.). If absent, always applies.
- `rangerException?: boolean` — if true, a company containing at least one
  ranger is exempt from returning.

Used by *Snowstorm* (tw-91), *Foul Fumes* (tw-36), *Long Winter* (le-117).

```json
{ "type": "force-return-to-origin",
  "condition": { "sitePath.wildernessCount": { "$gte": 1 } } }

{ "type": "force-return-to-origin",
  "condition": { "$or": [{ "sitePath.shadowCount": { "$gte": 1 } },
                         { "sitePath.darkCount": { "$gte": 1 } }] },
  "rangerException": true }
```

### 37. `cancel-chain-return-to-origin`

In-play ally ability: tap this ally during the M/H chain declaring window
to negate an unresolved chain entry that carries a `force-return-to-origin`
effect and would apply to the ally's company.

Only the resource (active) player may use this ability. Only untapped allies
qualify. One `cancel-return-to-origin` action is emitted per eligible (ally,
target entry) pair.

Fields:
- `cost: { tap: "self" }` — tapping the ally is the cost.

Implementation: `legal-actions/chain.ts` `cancelReturnToOriginChainActions()`
emits the legal actions. `chain-reducer.ts` `handleCancelReturnToOrigin()`
taps the ally, marks the chain entry as `negated: true`, and flips priority
to the opponent.

Used by *Goldberry* (tw-245).

```json
{ "type": "cancel-chain-return-to-origin", "cost": { "tap": "self" } }
```

### 38. `fetch-wizard-on-store`

Trigger: when a permanent event carrying this effect is stored at a Haven
during the organization phase, if the resource player's Wizard is **not**
already in play, a `wizard-search-on-store` pending resolution is enqueued.
The player may then search their play deck or discard pile for any Wizard and
play him at that Haven, free of the one-character-per-turn limit. The player
may also skip the search.

Fields: none.

Implementation:

- `reducer-organization.ts` `handleStoreItem()` detects the effect after
  clearing `bearer-cannot-untap` constraints and enqueues the resolution.
- `engine/legal-actions/pending.ts` `wizardSearchOnStoreActions()` emits one
  `play-wizard-from-search` action per eligible Wizard in the deck/discard
  plus a `skip-wizard-search` action.
- `engine/pending-reducers.ts` `applyWizardSearchOnStoreResolution()` handles
  both actions.

Used by *The Windlord Found Me* (dm-164).

```json
{ "type": "fetch-wizard-on-store" }
```
