# @meccg/sim — Headless Simulation Harness

In-process self-play harness for the MECCG engine, built for AI training and
evaluation (see `specs/2026-06-29-ai-training-system-plan.md`, phases P0–P1).
Games run at RAM speed with no WebSocket or child processes: the runner loops
`projectPlayerView` → agent → `reduce` until game over. Agents only ever see
their own projected `PlayerView` — hidden information stays hidden.

Given the same `(seed, decks, agents)` a game is **bit-reproducible**: all
engine randomness flows through the seeded `RngState`, and each agent draws
from its own seeded stream.

## CLIs

```sh
# Throughput + statistics benchmark (the P0 gate)
npm run bench -w @meccg/sim -- --games 1000 --seed 20000 \
  [--agents random,random] [--decks challenge-deck-a,challenge-deck-b] \
  [--max-decisions N] [--out stats.json]

# Play games with a live decision transcript; optionally record replays
npm run play -w @meccg/sim -- --agents heuristic,heuristic --seed 7 \
  [--games N] [--replay-dir DIR] [--quiet] [--no-candidates] [--max-candidates N]

# Play back a saved replay as a text transcript; verify by re-simulation
npm run replay -w @meccg/sim -- path/to/replay.jsonl [--verify] [--steps] [--quiet]
```

Available agents: `random` (uniform over viable actions), `heuristic` (the
"Smart-AI" strategy, lifted from the text client into `src/ai/`).

## Replay format

A replay is a JSONL file (`ReplayRecord` per line):

1. `header` — format version, timestamp, seed, both players (name, agent,
   deck ID, alignment), decision cap. Seed + deck IDs make the game
   reproducible from the header alone.
2. `decision` (interleaved with `transition`) — one per agent decision:
   turn/phase/step, acting player and agent, the full weighted candidate
   list (action type, canonical `actionId`, weight, and human-readable
   description for the top candidates), the chosen action verbatim, the
   engine effects it produced (dice rolls, notifications), and think time.
3. `transition` — emitted on every phase/step/turn change with a public
   score snapshot (tournament scores + raw marshalling-point totals), so
   score progression can be charted without re-simulating.
4. `result` — outcome, winner, win reason, final scores, and the per-game
   statistics summary.

`--verify` re-creates the game from the header and re-applies every recorded
action, checking `stateSeq`/turn/phase at each step and the final winner —
proof that the replay is an authentic record of a legal game.

## Statistics

Every game produces a `GameStatsSummary` (embedded in the `result` record and
in `--out` files): decisions and turns, per-phase and per-player decision
counts, chosen-action-type histogram, branching-factor distribution
(min/mean/percentiles + bucketed histogram), dice-roll totals, effect counts,
agent think time, and the score-by-turn trajectory. `aggregateStats` folds
game summaries into batch-level numbers: games/sec, decisions/sec, outcome
and win-reason counts, wins by seat, and distributions across games.

These numbers are the reference dataset for the training plan — archive
`--out` files to compare engine versions and agent generations.

## Library surface

```ts
import {
  playGame,                      // run one game headless
  createRandomAgent, createHeuristicAgent,
  loadDeck, listDecks,           // data/decks catalog
  ReplayWriter, readReplay, verifyReplay,
  StatsCollector, aggregateStats,
  TranscriptPrinter,             // live text transcript observer
} from '@meccg/sim';

const run = playGame({
  agents: [createHeuristicAgent(), createHeuristicAgent()],
  decks: [loadDeck('challenge-deck-a'), loadDeck('challenge-deck-b')],
  seed: 42,
  observers: [new TranscriptPrinter()],
});
```

Custom agents implement the `Agent` interface: `chooseAction(context)` gets
the projected view, the viable actions, the full evaluated candidate list,
and a seeded `random` stream, and returns the chosen action plus (optionally)
the weighted candidates it considered — which flow into transcripts, replays,
and future training data.
