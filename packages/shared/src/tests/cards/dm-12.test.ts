/**
 * @module dm-12.test
 *
 * Card test: Gergeli (dm-12)
 * Type: minion-character
 * Race: Man | Skills: scout, diplomat | Prowess/Body: 3/9 | Mind: 5 | DI: 2 | MP: 2
 * Homesites: Shrel-Kain, Lake-town, Easterling Camp
 *
 * "Unique. Agent."
 *
 * Gergeli has no special effects beyond the generic `agent` keyword, so the whole
 * card is exercised by the generic agent machinery:
 *
 * Rules exercised:
 * - "Agent." — keywords includes "agent"; Gergeli can be played face-down as a
 *   hazard during the opponent's M/H phase and counts one against the hazard
 *   limit (rule 2.IV.vii.1), and is blocked once the limit is reached.
 * - "Unique." — unique: true; a second Gergeli revealed while one is already
 *   face-up is immediately discarded (rule 9.05).
