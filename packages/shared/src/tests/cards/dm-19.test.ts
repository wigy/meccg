/**
 * @module dm-19.test
 *
 * Card test: Leamon (dm-19)
 * Type: minion-character
 * Race: Man | Skills: warrior | Prowess/Body: 5/8 | Mind: 3 | DI: 0 | MP: 1
 * Homesites: Cameth Brin, Dunnish Clan-hold
 *
 * "Unique. Agent."
 *
 * Leamon has no special effects beyond the generic `agent` keyword, so the whole
 * card is exercised by the generic agent machinery:
 *
 * Rules exercised:
 * - "Agent." — keywords includes "agent"; Leamon can be played face-down as a
 *   hazard during the opponent's M/H phase and counts one against the hazard
 *   limit (rule 2.IV.vii.1), and is blocked once the limit is reached.
 * - "Unique." — unique: true; a second Leamon revealed while one is already
 *   face-up is immediately discarded (rule 9.05).
